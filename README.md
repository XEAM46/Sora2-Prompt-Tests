## 1）rap battle：

```
A high-energy rap battle between Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein on a futuristic sci-fi stage. The camera alternates between close-ups and dramatic wide shots as they diss each other with sharp lyrics. Newton, in a classic 17th-century outfit, raps with a British accent about gravity and apples. Einstein, with wild hair and a German accent, fires back about relativity and space-time. Their lip-sync is perfectly timed to the beat, and their facial expressions are intense and animated. The background pulses with neon lights and holographic equations, reacting to the rhythm. The crowd of AI-generated scientists cheers them on in sync with the music. It feels like a rap battle from another dimension.zho

## 2）乐高风格 + 场景转换连贯 + 音效：

```
A dynamic camera glides through a miniature LEGO world, where an epic adventure unfolds. All sound effects—footsteps, explosions, cars, dragons—are created using mouth sounds by a single AI-generated voice artist. As each sound is made, the visuals instantly respond: LEGO characters jump into action, cars race, spaceships take off, volcanoes erupt. The journey moves through LEGO-built environments—city streets, underwater ruins, space stations, and lava lairs. The video is fast-paced, playful, and visually rich, like a blend between The LEGO Movie and next-gen AI storytelling. The sound-to-visual sync creates a magical, toy-driven universe where imagination controls reality.zho

## 3）人物奔跑、多人物剧情、对话、指令遵循：

```
A high-quality cinematic animation of a dramatic chase scene during golden hour. Ronald McDonald, dressed in his iconic red and yellow clown costume, is running frantically down the street holding a large KFC bucket of fried chicken. Behind him, Colonel Sanders, wearing his classic white suit, black tie, and glasses, is angrily chasing him. They are in front of a red KFC restaurant with the iconic logo clearly visible. The camera follows them with smooth motion blur to enhance the speed. Include dynamic lighting, realistic shadows, and intense facial expressions. Make the scene humorous and cartoonishly dramatic, as if it were part of a fast-food commercial parody.zho
```

## 4）控制 动作顺序 和 台词，并且保持极为自然的表情和语气：



https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2bfd048-6052-4e65-986e-7ce48b6ca635


```
A small comedy club. Brick wall backdrop, soft spotlight hits center stage. A tall, elegant model walks up in heels, mic in hand. The room goes quiet. She raises an eyebrow and says coolly: "I’m a model. I get paid to stand... and sometimes blink." She shifts her weight, gestures casually to the crowd.zho
```

## 5）街道反射球测试：

Some silver reflecting sphere rolling on the street in the LA. Camera follows it. Many reflections. hyper realistic.zho
```
